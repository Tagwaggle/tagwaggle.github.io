          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>The Taniti website was designed as a fictional town site, offering visitors information on places to visit, stay, and how to navigate the town. I created the wireframes and built the website using Webflow, ensuring it was visually engaging yet easy to navigate.</p>

        <section class="usability-feedback">
          <h2>Summary of Usability Feedback</h2>
          <p>The overall feedback from the users was positive, with some issues regarding navigation, layout, and naming conventions. Below are some key insights:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reviewer 1:</strong> Positive experience overall, but found navigation and naming conventions confusing. Suggestions for cleaning up navigation and clarifying text.</li>
            <li><strong>Reviewer 2:</strong> Reported issues with dropdown menu and pilot information clarity. Suggested adjusting the layout to improve flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Reviewer 3:</strong> Enjoyed the site overall, but had issues with landing page directing to the wrong page and confusion over contact information.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="design-process">
          <h2>Design Change Process</h2>
          <p>The initial top-down design approach was found to be ineffective after user testing. We decided to restructure the flow so that each subpage could be accessed directly from the homepage. Additionally, based on feedback, we added a contact page and decided to separate the FAQ and Contact Us pages for better clarity.</p>

        <section class="visuals">
          <h2>Visuals & Wireframes</h2>
          <p>Here are the wireframes and Webflow designs used to build the site:</p>

        <section class="future-plans">
          <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
          <p>Based on the feedback, we plan to refine the navigation and layout to make the site more user-friendly. Additional interactive elements, such as a map of the town, are being considered for the next update.</p>
