        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>My name is Joseph Guynes, and I am an experienced higher education instructor who focuses on students one by one. I love the feeling of helping a student and seeing that "ah-ha" moment. I hold an MBA, and a BS in Business Management, and I am currently working on a BS in Software Engineering. I am also currently working as an instructor in Power Skills for WGU.</p>
        <p><strong>One-liner mission:</strong> Helping students one by one.</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>MBA (2023)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>BS in Business Management (2022)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Google UX Certificate (2024)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>A+ (2023)</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My unique teaching style:</h3>
        <p>I teach students where they are—recognizing that not everyone comes to me with the same skills, so I have to adapt to them.</p>

        <h3>Tools & technologies I use:</h3>
        <p>I integrate SEL (Social-Emotional Learning) into all my instruction to create a holistic learning environment.</p>

        <h2>What I Believe</h2>
        <p><strong>Learning Philosophy:</strong> I believe that everyone has the capacity to learn, given the right circumstances.</p>
        <p><strong>Why Creativity & Student-Centered Approaches Matter:</strong> You should always use all of your brain, not just the right or left—incorporate everything, and you will see success.</p>

        <h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I’m an 80s kid, and I love <em>Gummi Bears</em>, <em>Darkwing Duck</em>, and <em>A Goofy Movie</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong> "Doesn't matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right. This nation was founded on one principle above all else: The requirement that we stand up for what we believe, no matter the odds or the consequences. When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world — 'No, YOU move.'" ~ Captain America</li>
